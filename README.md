## GRAPHICS ALGORITHMS

This is a folder which contains graphics algorithms and their implementations.

### Robo.c

The robo.c program is a program which helps you in drawing a robot.
The robot is drawn around a reference point. The DDA Line Algorithm was used in making the program.
The DDA Line algorithm exists inside the program in a function so you can have a look at what the DDA line algorithm is,
inside this program itself.<br><br>
The image below shows the Output of the program!

### Car.c
The car.c file is a program which shows an animation of a moving car.
It has been drawn using the line function in the graphics library.

    line(x1,y1,x2,y2)
    where, x1,y1 ---- starting points of line
    and x2,y2 ------- ending points of the line.
    
The animation takes place by the concept of translation.
We've put the car in a for loop incrementing the values of x co-ordinates of all the line functions by i

The final out put will look this way!
