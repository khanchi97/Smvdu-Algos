## Insertion Sort

It is a simple Sorting algorithm which sorts the array by shifting elements one by one. Following are some of the important characteristics of Insertion Sort.

1.It has one of the simplest implementation<br>
2.It is efficient for smaller data sets, but very inefficient for larger lists.<br>
3.Insertion Sort is adaptive, that means it reduces its total number of steps if given a partially sorted list, hence it increases its efficiency.<br>
4.It is better than Selection Sort and Bubble Sort algorithms.<br>
5.Its space complexity is less. Like Bubble Sorting, insertion sort also requires a single additional memory space.<br>
6.It is a Stable sorting, as it does not change the relative order of elements with equal keys<br>

### Complexity Anlaysis
Worst Case Time Complexity : O(n2)<br>
Best Case Time Complexity : O(n)<br>
Average Time Complexity : O(n2)<br>
Space Complexity : O(1)<br>
