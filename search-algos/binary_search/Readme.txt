Binary Search is one of the efficient search techniques with run-time complexity O(log n). 
It divides the sorted array entered by user into two parts and checks for the number entered using two parameters i.e. the indexes of 
beginning and end of the range in which the element to be searched is present.The other search techniques include linear search etc.

Exemplary Input:
 Enter number of elements
  7
  Enter 7 integers in increasing order
  2
  3
  5
  7
  8
  11
  15
  Enter value to find
  8
  
  FINAL OUTPUT:
  8 found at position 5.

P.S.: For extra info,We can also use the method Arrays.binarySearch(alphabets, 'a') by importing java.util.Arrays where alphabets in an array
        of alphabets and the character whose position is to be searched is 'a'.But, the code below explains to us the functioning of
        this beautiful search technique.
