In computer science, the Fibonacci search technique is a method of searching a sorted array using a divide and conquer algorithm that narrows down possible locations with 
the aid of Fibonacci numbers. Compared to binary search where the sorted array is divided into two equal-sized parts, one of which is examined further, Fibonacci search 
divides the array into two parts that have sizes that are consecutive Fibonacci numbers.Fibonacci search has an average- and worst-case complexity of O(log n).
