## Dijkstra's Algorithm

Dijkstra's algorithm is an algorithm for finding the shortest paths between nodes in a graph, which may represent, for example, road networks.
It was conceived by computer scientist Edsger W. Dijkstra in 1956 and published three years later.

For a given source node in the graph, the algorithm finds the shortest path between that node and every other.It can also be used for finding the shortest paths from a single node to a single destination node by stopping the algorithm once the shortest path to the destination node has been determined. <br>For example, if the nodes of the graph represent cities and edge path costs represent driving distances between pairs of cities connected by a direct road, Dijkstra's algorithm can be used to find the shortest route between one city and all other cities.
